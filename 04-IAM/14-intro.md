# IAM

- users & group
- login create `rootUser`
  - create user only
  - edit user
  - not used to actual tasks
  - admin user

# user

- each person has user
- can belong multiple groups

# group

- only contain users
- no nest group

- developer group
- operations group

# why users & groups?

- to give permission

# IAM: permissions

- Users & Groups can attach JSON called `policies`

# least permission

- give minimum permission is best practice in AWS
